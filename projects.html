            <h3>Personal Website</h3>
            <p>Date: 4/4/20 - Present<br>My personal website is one of my side projects during the COVID-19 quarantine as my first attempt at web development and UI/UX design. Programmed in HTML and CSS and designed with Adobe XD and Illustrator, the website is built from scratch and hosted using GitHub Pages. Visit my github at https://github.com/carleenli. I started this project in order to showcase my experiences and passions, as well as understand what UI/UX design was. I planned to learn new skill sets, including HTML and Adobe XD. I decided to build the website from scratch instead of using templates in order to learn more of the language. As I progressed, I began adding more skills in order to improve the site, such as CSS, and Adobe Illustrator. I hope to continue adding features to the website in the coming months.
